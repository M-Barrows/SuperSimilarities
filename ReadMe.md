# Super Similarities

# [Demo](https://m-barrows.shinyapps.io/SuperSimilarities/)

This repository contains an .Rproj that compares various superheros (DC and Marvel) to one another. The primary app displays a network graph which links superheroes based on the number of shared comic book appearances. The second app compares the various characteristics of each superhero and assigns a similarity score. 

The purpose of this project was to teach myself how to construct network graphs and similarity matricies in R. Feel free to use any of this material as long as you share a like and/or attribution. :)
